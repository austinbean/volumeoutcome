* Regressions 

do "/Users/austinbean/Desktop/Birth2005-2012/FilePathGlobal.do"

use "${birthdata}/Births2005-2012wCounts.dta"

* Drop home births.
drop if b_bplace != 1

bysort fid: gen fc = _n
bysort fid: egen brtotal = max(fc)

drop if brtotal < 25

* Regress on lagged volumes and year
logit neonataldeath i.ncdobyear lag_*_months

* Adding NeoIntensive and SoloIntermediate indicators.
logit neonataldeath i.ncdobyear lag_*_months NeoIntensive SoloIntermediate

* Adding some health states:
logit neonataldeath i.ncdobyear lag_*_months NeoIntensive SoloIntermediate

* Include a facility-specific term if available
* A bunch of facilities have no deaths - these are perfect predictors so they must be dropped.  
logit neonataldeath i.ncdobyear lag_*_months NeoIntensive SoloIntermediate i.fid if facinfo == 1
* The above WORKS and does converge reasonably quickly. 

* Adding insurance status:
logit neonataldeath i.ncdobyear lag_*_months NeoIntensive SoloIntermediate pay i.fid if facinfo == 1
 
* Adding some health states bca_aeno - hypsospa:  
logit neonataldeath i.ncdobyear b_m_educ lag_*_months NeoIntensive SoloIntermediate pay bca_aeno-hypsospa i.fid if facinfo == 1
* The above works as well - does converge and reasonably fast.

* Adding FE's for birth weight w500599 - w12501499
logit neonataldeath i.ncdobyear b_m_educ lag_*_months NeoIntensive SoloIntermediate pay bca_aeno-hypsospa i.fid w500599-w12501499 if facinfo == 1

* Adding multiple birth indicator "multiple"
logit neonataldeath i.ncdobyear b_m_educ lag_*_months NeoIntensive SoloIntermediate pay bca_aeno-hypsospa i.fid w500599-w12501499 multiple if facinfo == 1
* This one works, but takes a while:
estimates save nndweight
* file nndweight.ster saved to save time in the future.  


* Adding race information for mother:
logit neonataldeath i.ncdobyear b_m_educ lag_*_months NeoIntensive SoloIntermediate pay bca_aeno-hypsospa i.fid w500599-w12501499 m_hisnot m_rwhite m_rblack multiple if facinfo == 1
* saving the output:
estimates save nndwrace


* For level 3 only:
keep if facinfo == 1

* with lagged values of nicu admits, payment status, and firm FE's (works):
logit neonataldeath i.ncdobyear lag_*_months pay i.fid if  NeoIntensive == 1

* adding maternal education and health status (works):
logit neonataldeath i.ncdobyear b_m_educ lag_*_months pay bca_aeno-hypsospa i.fid if NeoIntensive == 1

* adding birth weight indicators (works) :
logit neonataldeath i.ncdobyear b_m_educ lag_*_months pay bca_aeno-hypsospa i.fid w500599-w12501499 if NeoIntensive == 1

* adding race indicators for mother ( ):
logit neonataldeath i.ncdobyear b_m_educ lag_*_months pay bca_aeno-hypsospa i.fid w500599-w12501499 m_hisnot m_rwhite m_rblack multiple if NeoIntensive == 1


* For Level 2 only - among those NOT transferred: if bo_tra1 == 0 & bo_trans == 0

* with lagged values of nicu admits, payment status, and firm FE's (works):
logit neonataldeath i.ncdobyear lag_*_months pay i.fid if  SoloIntermediate == 1 & bo_tra1 == 0 & bo_trans == 0

* adding maternal education and health status (works):
logit neonataldeath i.ncdobyear b_m_educ lag_*_months pay bca_aeno-hypsospa i.fid if SoloIntermediate == 1 & bo_tra1 == 0 & bo_trans == 0

* adding birth weight indicators (works ) :
logit neonataldeath i.ncdobyear b_m_educ lag_*_months pay bca_aeno-hypsospa i.fid w500599-w12501499 if SoloIntermediate == 1 & bo_tra1 == 0 & bo_trans == 0

* adding race indicators for mother (works ):
logit neonataldeath i.ncdobyear b_m_educ lag_*_months pay bca_aeno-hypsospa i.fid w500599-w12501499 m_hisnot m_rwhite m_rblack multiple if SoloIntermediate == 1 & bo_tra1 == 0 & bo_trans == 0

* When specializing to those not transferred, this gives magnitudes which are more reasonable: the negative effect in Intensive is much larger

* For level 1 among not transferred:
* These models must be different because the lagged volume indicators do not make sense

* with lagged values of nicu admits, payment status, and firm FE's (works):
logit neonataldeath i.ncdobyear lag_*_months pay i.fid if  SoloIntermediate == 0 & NeoIntensive == 0 & bo_tra1 == 0 & bo_trans == 0

* adding maternal education and health status (works):
logit neonataldeath i.ncdobyear b_m_educ lag_*_months pay bca_aeno-hypsospa i.fid if SoloIntermediate == 0 & NeoIntensive == 0 & bo_tra1 == 0 & bo_trans == 0

* adding birth weight indicators (works ) :
logit neonataldeath i.ncdobyear b_m_educ lag_*_months pay bca_aeno-hypsospa i.fid w500599-w12501499 if SoloIntermediate == 0 & NeoIntensive == 0& bo_tra1 == 0 & bo_trans == 0

* adding race indicators for mother (works ):
logit neonataldeath i.ncdobyear b_m_educ lag_*_months pay bca_aeno-hypsospa i.fid w500599-w12501499 m_hisnot m_rwhite m_rblack multiple if SoloIntermediate == 0 & NeoIntensive == 0 & bo_tra1 == 0 & bo_trans == 0
